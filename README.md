# My Personal Project - CPSC 210

## Create Your Own Story

For my project this term, I will design an application that would create a unique 
story for each user. Every time, the user will select one of few basic story templates 
(that I will write myself) and then be presented with a series of prompts 
that correlate to that story template. Then, after recording the answers to these prompts, 
the user will be able to read the full story with their answers filling gaps in the story.    
There are many people who will find the application interesting and useful, as 
its main purpose is *entertainment!* Therefore, anybody who is looking to get a little 
creative, wanting to write a story they can make unique to themselves, will find the 
application of good use.

**Reasons the project is of interest to me:**
- I like to read and write (both code and stories), so this is an opportunity to combine both.
- It's a great way to do something creative in a science course, combining different disciplines 
together.
- I see this as something that can bring a good laugh and entertainment to others.
